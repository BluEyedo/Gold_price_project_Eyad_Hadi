# IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING K-MEAN
# Introduction :
Image segmentation is an important step in image processing, and it seems everywhere if we want to analyze whatâ€™s inside the image. For example, if we seek to find if there is a chair or person inside an indoor image, we may need image segmentation to separate objects and analyze each object individually to check what it is. Image segmentation usually serves as the pre-processing before pattern recognition, feature extraction, and compression of the image.
Image segmentation is the classification of an image into different groups. Many kinds of research have been done in the area of image segmentation using clustering. There are different methods and one of the most popular methods is K-Means clustering algorithm.
